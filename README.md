## Overview
This project is a terminal-based Scrabble game where various AI algorithms were implemented and assessed for their level of play. Algorithms include Monte Carlo Tree Search _(MCTS)_, A*, Breadth First Search _(BFS)_, Depth First Search _(DFS)_, Uniform Cost Search _(UCS)_, and Greedy Best First Search _(GBFS)_. 

## Instructions
To run the program, 
```cmd
python build/scrabble.py
```
You can play with up to four other human players or play against one AI algorithm. Additionally, you can spectate two AI algorithms against eachother.
